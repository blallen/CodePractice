I trained a logistic regression model with a large number of binary input features. But my online serving system is RAM-constrained and cannot load the model. What can I do to make the model smaller, sacrificing as little accuracy as possible?


"Build a system which extracts positive and negative aspects of a product from user reviews. For example a review:
 ""The camera of the phone is really bad""
 We need to extract a negative aspect which is ""camera""
 Another review:
 ""It has a beautiful design""
 We need to extract a positive aspect which is ""design"""
